# End-to-End Machine Learning Project
In this chapter you will work through an example project end to end,
pretending to be a recently hired data scientist at a real estate company. Here are the main steps you will go through:
1. 🧐 Look at the big picture.
2. 🤗 Get the data.
3. 🫣 Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. 👩‍🔬 Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
5. 🦹‍♀️ Select a model and train it.
6. 💇‍♀️ Fine-tune your model.
7. 💃 Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.

## First Notebook
In First Notebook you will find my code to get data, visualize it and the final pipeline.

## Second Notebook
Explore model training & fine-tuning. where I explore RandomSearch, GridSearch.
